# COVID-19 Information Tracking App
## Amanda Ruan
### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Based on existing orgnizational and governmental COVID-19 apps and websites, this project aims to create a COVID-19 Information Tracking app that assists the public needs and helps the public to easily access governmental information related to COVID-19. The app will support a visualization of COVID-19 data with statistical graphs, a visualization of the spread of COVID-19 with an interactive Map tool, provide updated national and local goverment guidance and news with a Resources tool, and assists individual needs with a Q&A tool. My motivation to create this project is that there were only a few local governmental apps developed specifically for COVID-19 information and the information was limited in term of the range and scale of coverage. In addition, CDC also did not develope an information app specifically for COVID-19, and instead the CDC app only leads users to a mobile version of the CDC website without fitting the information to meet user experience with mobile. Moreover, it could also be hard for the public to access particular information they need because of the exceeding amount of information from a variety of sources and the lack of organizations of the information. Therefore, I hope I could contribute to the User Experience/Interface Design of public health information apps and also better help the public in acquiring the most relevant pandemic information easily.

### Clear design statement: 
During quarantine, I have observed many people, such as my friends and family, who were overwhelmed and confused by both the abundance of information on the Internet and the platforms that provide the information, as the platforms’ designs might not be user-friendly. I think it is important for the public to gain timely, clear, relevant, and true information through the uses of public health mobile platforms, especially during this time.

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
(Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated)
#### Heuristic Evaluation
I analyzed two public health mobile apps that feature information related to the pandemic COVID-19 for the public. One is the official app of CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and the other app is called COVID-19Tracker, which is developed by HealthLynked Corp and updates worldwide COVID-19 information. Since early last quarter, I have been monitoring information related to the outbreak of the pandemic, including news, social media messages, and also relevant webpages, programs and apps developed for the public. CDC app and COVID-19Tracker app are two of the many apps I downloaded in the early days to track COVID-19 information.

#### Usability Testing
This usability testing evaluated the COVID-19Tracker app, aiming to see whether the features on COVID-19Tracker app are navigable, whether the app presents clear information related to COVID-19 data and news, whether users can find the information they need on the app, and users' attitude towards the app.[read more>>](https://github.com/amandamandayuen/DH150-SPR20-UT-Assignment02)

### User Research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
This User Research aimed to understand more about the target users and the context users are in. [read more>>](https://github.com/amandamandayuen/DH150-SPR20-UserInContext-Assignment05)
### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Based on the feedback from User Research, this activity created three personas and tasks, aiming to tell a story from a user’s point of view, understand individual context, needs, problems, emotions, and approach or desire to solve problems.[read more>>](https://github.com/amandamandayuen/DH150-Assignment05-PersonaStorytelling)

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]
Based on User Research and Personas development, this low-fidelity prototyping created a draft version of the wireframes of the COVID-19 app. The purpose is to see whether the features work as expected and whether a potential user can easily navigate through the features and finds what he/she needs.
