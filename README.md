# COVID-19 Information Tracking App
## Amanda Ruan
### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Based on existing orgnizational and governmental COVID-19 apps and websites, this project aims to create a COVID-19 Information Tracking app that assists the public needs and helps the public to easily access governmental information related to COVID-19. The app will support a visualization of COVID-19 data with statistical graphs, a visualization of the spread of COVID-19 with an interactive Map tool, provide updated national and local goverment guidance and news with a Resources tool, and assists individual needs with a Q&A tool. My motivation to create this project is that there were only a few local governmental apps developed specifically for COVID-19 information and the information was limited in term of the range and scale of coverage. In addition, CDC also did not develope an information app specifically for COVID-19, and instead the CDC app only leads users to a mobile version of the CDC website without fitting the information to meet user experience with mobile. Moreover, it could also be hard for the public to access particular information they need because of the exceeding amount of information from a variety of sources and the lack of organizations of the information. Therefore, I hope I could create an app, which covers both local and national COVID-19 information, to help the public to acquire relevant pandemic information more conviently, and to contribute to the User Experience/Interface Design of public health information apps.

### Clear design statement: 
During quarantine, I have observed many people, such as my friends and family, who were overwhelmed and confused by both the abundance of information on the Internet and the platforms that provide the information. People might find it hard to search for and locate information they want because of the amount of information and variety of sources, and sometimes certain information might not be provided and could not be find easily. In addition, the platforms might not be user-friendly enough to allow the general public to easily look for what they need. Conviently accessing timely, clear, and relevant information is important to the public, especially during this time. People need to be informed of the current development of the COVID-19 situation, and need support in knowing what they should do and where they can seek for help when they need, as the pandemic is relevant to each individual. Providing the conviently-accessed mobile platform for organized COVID-19 information could help to better inform the public and reduce the frustration people encounter when seeking for help. 

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
#### Heuristic Evaluation
- To better understand current situations of COVID-19 related apps, I analyzed two public health mobile apps that feature COVID-19 information for the public: 1) The official CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) app, which features CDC articles and news, 2) The COVID-19Tracker app (developed by HealthLynked Corp), which updates worldwide COVID-19 cases and news. Based on Nielson's 10 Heuristic Principles, the major issues I found include: 
  1. (COVID-19Tracker app) No instruction provide to show how to apply the filter buttons on map page (not obvious enough as buttons that could be applied)
  2. (COVID-19Tracker app) No search tool or filter tool provided for users to search for news they want on the Feed page
  3. (CDC app) Menu button for news/articles categories is not obvious to new users
  4. (CDC app) Lacks bottom tap bar (lack of consistency with conventional app design)
  5. (Both apps) need to improve the system for item recognition rather than recall

#### Usability Testing
- To better understand how a person would actually interact with an app, this usability testing evaluated the COVID-19Tracker app using three main usability metric - effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. This testing aims to see whether the features on COVID-19Tracker app are navigable, whether the app presents clear information related to COVID-19 data and news, whether a user can effectively and efficiently find the information she/he needs, and users' attitude towards the app. Based on results from Heuristic Evaluation, I developed three tasks for the participant to complete. I found that the user did struggle with recognizing certain less visiable features and looking for specific information, as these aspects of the UI/UX design of the interface were not user-friendly enough.

### User Research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
User Research aimed to understand more about target users and the actual context users are in, such as which groups of people would actually use the apps, and the target users' needs, motivation, thoughts, feelings and activities. I conducted an interview with a potential user, and learned about the user's thoughts and emotional needs during quarantine, how the user typically consume COVID-19 information with her choices of mobile apps, and how the user struggled to look for certain information because of a lack of information or lack of organized categories for the information.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Based on the feedback from User Research, this activity created three personas and tasks, aiming to tell a story from a real userâ€™s point of view, understand individual context, needs, problems, emotions, and approach or desire to solve problems.[read more>>](https://github.com/amandamandayuen/DH150-Assignment05-PersonaStorytelling)

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]
Based on User Research and Personas development, this low-fidelity prototyping created a draft version of the wireframes of the COVID-19 app. The purpose is to see whether the features work as expected and whether a potential user can easily navigate through the features and finds what he/she needs.
